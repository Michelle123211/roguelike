A rogue-like template built on top of [Zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon).

It shall eventually be multiplatform, but currently only JVM build is functional.

### Prerequisites

Java 8+.

## Running

The most important Gradle tasks are:
 - `renderPng` - renders the first level into `out/render.png`
 - `playGame` - launches the game on JVM
 - `shadowJar` - will build a runnable JAR into `build/libs/roguelike-<version>-all.jar`
